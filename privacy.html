          <p>
            We may collect a variety of personal data from users to facilitate
            the functionality of our services. This may include student
            information such as full names, email addresses, course enrollments,
            assignment submissions, grades, and other academic performance data
            retrieved from Canvas. Additionally, we collect teacher and
            administrator data including names, roles, contact details, and
            usage activity. Furthermore, we may track interactions within our
            platform, logging user engagement, preferences, and behavioral

          <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
          <p>
            The personal data we collect serves several essential purposes.
            First and foremost, we use this data to track student academic
            progress, monitor their achievements, and provide automated rewards
            based on predefined milestones. Additionally, the information helps
            us personalize user experiences, refine platform features, and
            enhance system efficiency. We may also use user data to communicate
            relevant updates, troubleshoot technical issues, and ensure
            compliance with applicable regulations.

          <p>
            We take data privacy seriously and do not engage in selling,
            renting, or trading personal information. However, in certain
            instances, we may share user data with third-party service providers
            who assist in essential operational processes, such as reward
            fulfillment, system hosting, and payment processing. These
            third-party entities are contractually obligated to maintain the
            confidentiality and security of user data, ensuring compliance with
            industry-standard privacy regulations. Additionally, we may disclose
            user information when required by law, such as in response to a
            legal subpoena, government request, or to protect our legal rights
            and security.

          <p>
            Ensuring the security of your data is our top priority. We employ
            advanced security measures including end-to-end encryption, secure
            storage protocols, and multi-layered access controls to protect
            against unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, we
            conduct routine security audits, vulnerability assessments, and
            system updates to address emerging threats. User authentication
            mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication, may also be
            implemented to reinforce account security.
